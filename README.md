# Digit Recognizer

### Installation

This workbook requires [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-367/) to run.

Navigate to the digit-recognizer folder after downloading.

Create and activate a virtual environment for our dependencies.

```sh
$ virtualenv -p python3.6 env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the jupyter notebook
```sh
$ jupyter notebook
```

The notebook should now be hosted at http://localhost:8888/notebooks/digit.ipynb

### Not working? Other options:
I have uploaded three alternatives for viewing this implementation:
- digit.html can be downloaded and viewed in the browser. You can view it [here](https://github.com/tjgambs/digit-recognizer/blob/master/digit.html)
- digit.py can be downloaded and run just as any other python file. You can view it [here](https://github.com/tjgambs/digit-recognizer/blob/master/digit.py)
- /digit/digit.md can be downloaded and viewed in a markdown viewer such as GitHub. You can view it [here](https://github.com/tjgambs/digit-recognizer/blob/master/digit/digit.md)
